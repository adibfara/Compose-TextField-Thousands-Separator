# Compose Thousands Separator for TextFields

You can find the code and the required tests for implementation of a thousands separator inside a `TextField` in compose.

You can find the main file [here](https://github.com/adibfara/Compose-TextField-Thousands-Separator/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/snakydesign/composetextview/ui/PriceFilter.kt).

Note: You can have your own implementation of a thousand separator (based on locale or ...) and pass it as `thousandSeparator` argument.
